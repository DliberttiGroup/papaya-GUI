dev experience.

# Getting Started

>[!NOTE]
>
> As of now, Papaya-GUI supports only static integration. 
> This means you need to manually include the JAR file in your project.

To use in your project get the .jar file from the realise tags
then put in a folder beetween your project for example ```./libs/papaya/papaya.jar```

then at the moment of compile your project simple run 
```javac -cp "[path_to_papaya_.jar] [name_of_your_file.java]"```

To use Papaya-GUI in your Java project, follow these steps:

1. **Download the JAR File:**

   Obtain the Papaya-GUI JAR file from the release tags on our repository. 
   The JAR file will be named something like `lib-0.0.01.jar`.

2. **Add the JAR to Your Project:**

   Place the downloaded JAR file in a directory within your project. For example, 
   you might create a `libs` directory and put the JAR file there:

    ```
    ./libs/papaya/papaya.jar
    ```
3. **Run your code:**

    When running your Java project, include the JAR file in the classpath 
    using the `-cp` (or `--classpath`) option. For example:


    ```bash
    java -cp "./libs/papaya/papaya.jar" path/to/your/JavaFile.java
    ```
